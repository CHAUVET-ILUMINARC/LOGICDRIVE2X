<div style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline;">
  This update reduces the port fixture capacity from 40pcs down to 30pcs on drives with ST controllers. <br>
  Drives with GD controllers are immune from this reduction in fixture count/port. You can find which controller is used in your drive by reviewing the webserver. It is posted in the top-right section of the webservers.
